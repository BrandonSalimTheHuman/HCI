		<h4>My two main hobbies are playing/listening to music and playing games</h4>
		<h5>For music, I mainly play the piano.
		<h5>I've also learnt how to sing and play the violin, but those aren't my main instruments.</h5>
		<h5>I've also composed a bunch of songs on the piano</h5>
		<h6>Fun fact: I've been playing the piano for 14,5 years.</h6>
		<h6>That wasn't a joke.</h6>
		<a href="html2.html"><h5>Here is a short list of games I play regularly.<h5></a>
